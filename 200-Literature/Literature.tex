\emph{The purpose of academic research, among others, is to contribute to the body of existing knowledge.
The student should show what relevant existing knowledge relates to what s/he wants to do research on. The student should: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Seek literature that lends support to the line of argument of the study.
	\item The specific objectives of the study should guide what literature to review.
	\item The student should assess the findings of other studies to show how they support one’s argument and the gaps in existing knowledge as far as the proposed research is concerned.
\end{enumerate}
The outcome of literature review is to link one’s proposed research to existing knowledge, identify gaps that justify the study and launch the argument for one’s own research.
It must have a logical flow and one should not over-quote.
