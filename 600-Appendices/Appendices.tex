\emph{This section contains all
\begin{itemize}
	\item questionnaires,
	\item interview transcripts,
	\item pilot reports,
	\item detailed tables, etc.
\end{itemize}
This section should contain material that supplements the main text of the report (spreadsheets, detailed experimental results, details of equation derivation, program listings, etc.). 
If an equation is included in the body of the report, the derivation of that equation could be shown in the Appendix, or if you have a graph from a spreadsheet or program calculation, you could include the spreadsheet data or a program listing in the Appendix. 
The key point is that the Appendix is supplemental information. 
Depending on what was requested in the problem statement, detailed drawings might also go in the Appendix and only the overall assembly drawing would go in the body.
