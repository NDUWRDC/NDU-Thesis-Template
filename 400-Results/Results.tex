\label{cha:Results}      %% No special characters, no space character

\emph{This section shall specifically include \textbf{design calculations}, \textbf{the drawings}, \textbf{the bills of quantities} and \textbf{cost estimates} and \textbf{cost benefit analysis}, \textbf{operations and maintenance plan} and \textbf{environmental impact assessment} of the project.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Discussion of the solution - how well does it solve the problem?	
	This section is the heart of the report and should include details of the solution leading up to the proposed design.
	\item In addition, discussion of the cost benefit analysis should involve identified costs and benefits for the proposed project, the value attached to them, and assumptions made. 
	The analysis should also include the comparison between costs and benefits and decision criteria used.
