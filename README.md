# Ndejje University LaTeX Template for Research Reports

## Purpose

This set of files provides a template that can be used by all levels of students to write their paper in LaTeX. 
Some advantages of using the template are:
* Authors can focus on content, since the correct style is automatically applied.
* The desired citation-style is used throughout and can easily be changed for the entire document.
* The required structure is prepared and authors can add content to chapters right away.
* Uniform linking within the document makes it easier to directly jump to sections from the table of content, to listed bibliography, to tables, graphs, images from the text.
